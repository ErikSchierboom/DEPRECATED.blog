Instructions will, inevitably, be confusing. Not all the instructions, and not
all the time, but some certainly some instructions are confusing to some
people, some of the time.

Sometimes they're confusing because they're poorly worded. At other times,
they're outdated or downright wrong.

Or perhaps they just have a typo.

There's a caveat, though:

The README for each exercise is shared across all the language tracks. The
README will be the same for `bob` in Perl, as it is in Haskell, Swift, or
PHP. Because of this, it needs to be high-level enough to allow for the
differences in the various languages. In other words: no specific references
to syntax or datastructures.

Each language nails down the spec in its own test suite, which allows the
language to treat the problem in a way that is interesting and idiomatic.

The README treads a very fine line between useful ambiguity and confusing
vagueness.

The shared metadata for all the exercises live in the
[github.com/exercism/x-common](https://github.com/exercism/x-common)
repository.

There aren't any rules about what a good exercism problem README looks like.
If in doubt, [open up a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/exercism/x-common/issues/new) describing your
suggestion, or hit us up in the [support
