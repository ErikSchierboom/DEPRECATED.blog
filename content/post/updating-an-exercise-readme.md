Instructions will, inevitably, be confusing. Not all the instructions, and not
all the time, but some certainly some instructions are confusing to some
people, some of the time.

Sometimes they're confusing because they're poorly worded. At other times,
they're outdated or downright wrong.

Or perhaps they just have a typo.

Fixing an Exercism exercise README can be one of the simplest ways to
help a lot of people. The README for each exercise is shared across all the
language tracks. The bulk of the README will be the same for `bob` in Perl, as
it is in Haskell, Swift, or PHP.

The README treads a very fine line between useful ambiguity and confusing
vagueness. The problem description needs to be high-level enough to allow for
the differences in the various languages. In other words: no specific
references to syntax or datastructures.

Each language nails down the exact specification for the exercise in its own
test suite, which allows the language to treat the problem in a way that is
interesting and idiomatic.

## Contributing a Fix

If you want to fix an exercise README, then use the name of the directory that
the exercism was delivered in, e.g. `bob` or `hamming`, and find the
equivalent markdown file in the [shared metadata
repository](https://github.com/exercism/x-common), e.g. `bob.md` or
`hamming.md`.

There aren't any rules about what a good exercism problem README looks like.

suggestion, or hit us up in the [support
