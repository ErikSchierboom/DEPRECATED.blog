Exercism is about practice, and respectful conversations about code. It is
about diving deep into the simplest concepts; it's about choices and
trade-offs. Design and readability.

The project is free and [open source](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io).

People who are fairly new to programming have found that it helps them bridge
the gap between online tutorials and solving problems independently. Many
programmers use Exercism to quickly get up to speed in a new language,
becoming familiar with that language's syntax, features, and idioms.

Here's a presentation from RubyConf Portugal 2014 that uses an example problem
from the Ruby track to talk about the underlying philosophy behind Exercism.

### The Origin Story

Exercism came out of two separate daily practices. The first was daily
nitpicking via email on Java problems at [The Cattle
Drive](http://www.javaranch.com/java-college.jsp), and the second was daily
warmup exercises at a pre-cursor to [Turing School of Software &
Design](http://turing.io/).

Exercism was never intended to be a product, and it came as a surprise that
people all over the world were excited about it. If you're interested in
hearing more about how Exercism came about, then check out the CodeNewbie
podcast episode, [Nitpicks and
Devils](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/nitpicks-and-devils).
